// Ids are commonly used to describe assets uniquely with a human-readable

//
// An id is represented as a string in the format: <package>.<name>
//
// An id_version is represented as a string in the format:
// <package>.<name>.<version>
//
// A version is formatted as described by semver.org.

// An Id uniquely identifies an asset (e.g., skill, resource type) in its
// respective catalog. If you change an Id's package or name field, the catalog
// will treat any new uploads as a completely different asset.
